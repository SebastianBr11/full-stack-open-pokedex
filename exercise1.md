## Java

Linting Tools for Java include Checkstyle, which is the most popular, because of its regular updates and great documentation,
and others like PMD, which can also be used for other languages, as well as UCDetector which stands for unnecessary code detector.

JUnit is a popular unit-testing framework, while JBehave is a framework for behaviour-driven development, which is intended to make
testing more accessible and intuitive for beginners and experts. Moreover, TestNG can be used for integration, functional and unit testing,
which makes this a very popular and powerful testing tool.

For building there are a plethora of command line tools, like Maven which can be configured using XML, Gradle, which has its own domain-specific
language, and Ant, which is the predecessor to Maven, which are all widely used.

There are many other continous integration tools beside Github Actions and Jenkins, namely Buddy, which has an extremely
user-friendly interface, Teamcity by JetBrains, Bamboo CI, Gitlab CI and many more.

The question of where the CI setup should be deployed, depends on a number of factors, like how often the app needs to be redeployed,
how many developers are working on it concurrently, or maybe there is already a server setup on-prem, or the company is already using a cloud provider for other servers.
